    <p>This is another of my favourite game, Minecraft dungeons. I have been playing this game everyday since the holidays started. It is really fun to play and can get a little grindy at times.</p>
    <h4>What is Minecraft Dungeons?</h4><hr>
    <p>Minecraft Dungeons is an action-adventure role-playing video game developed by Mojang Studios, Xbox Game Studios and Double Eleven. It was released on May 26, 2020, for Windows (via minecraftdungeons.net and the Microsoft Store/Xbox app), Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4, on November 10, 2020, for the Xbox Series X|S, and on September 22, 2021, for Steam for Windows. <hr> <p>Currently, I have been playing Minecraft Dungeons on my new Xbox series S.
    <p>I really like this game as I can collect different items and artifacts to be able to play the levels with ease and not get destroyed by the diffferent mobs in the game.<hr>
    <p>As of now, I am power level 83 and Level 59. I didn't really like the game that much when i started but i feel that it is more fun now as i can immerse in the beautiful levels as I go along.
    There are 3 different difficulty settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Default</li>--Mob spawns decently, not so crazy
      <li>Adventure</li>--Mobs spawns the same but they hit much harder
      <li>Apocalypse</li>--Mobs spawns everywhere and they can 1 hit kill you sometimes
    </ul>
